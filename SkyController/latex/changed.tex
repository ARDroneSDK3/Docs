\section{Non-fully integrated features}

This section presents some of the features that exists on Android phones and on the SkyController, but for which the SkyController API differs from the Android API.

\subsection{Battery level}

The battery level is \emph{not} integrated into the Android system, and thus can not be requested through the standard API. It is transmitted to the application as the last axis of the gamepad.

To convert from the axis value to the battery voltage, you can use the following equation:\\
\ARCode{float voltage = (float) (((battery + 1) * 1.25) * 1.6) + 9;}\\
Where \ARCode{battery} is the axis value. To further convert the voltage into a percentage, we use the following equation:\\
\ARCode{int percent = 100 - (int)(-14.52759414 * Math.pow(voltage, 3)}\\
\ARCode{    + 543.15310727 * Math.pow(voltage, 2)}\\
\ARCode{    - 6801.85740495 * voltage}\\
\ARCode{    + 28532.85560624);} \\
Which is then saturated between $0$ and $100$.
